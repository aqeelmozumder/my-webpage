		<p>Hi there! I am Aqeel, a Software Engineering student at the University of Victoria, Canada.</p>
		<p>	Since childhood, one of my main hobbies has been gaming, which sparked my passion of computers, <br> 
		and eventually lead me to Software Engineering. Software Engineering is a never ending puzzle and <br>
		I believe that through technology and innovation, we can transform and improve the lives of <br>
		many people around the world.</p>

		<p>In my free time, I enjoy problem solving challenges. I specialize in coding<br> 
		with several languages such as JavaScript, Java, Python, C, C#, HTML and CSS and database languages using SQL<br>
		My enthusiasm for Web Services Technology lead me to be proficient on Heroku, AJAX, REST API, JSON  <br> 
		</p>
		<p>
		At the momment, I am gaining knowledge on Software development and Network Communications<br>
		My favourite part about software development is the implementation of the life cycle such as<br>
		Agile and Lean management developments aims to shorten the system development life cycle and provide continous delivery <br>
		Moreover, I like debugging programs as I have always enjoyed diagnosing and fixing defects. Currently, I am learning<br>
		pipelining a software using Docker and Jenkins integrated with Git. I am also learning different methods of testing a software such as <br>
		Unit, Smoke, Integration and Acceptance.  </p>

		<p> I have always loved winning, but helping my team win brings me even greater satisfaction, as I am a strong <br> 
		believer in collective effort. Together, Everyone Achieves More. In order for me to play my role better as a <br> 
		teammate, I make sure that I am always up to date with current technologies and strive to be a better person.<br> 
		Certainly, there is much more to learn, many more problems to solve, and a lot more to build and I am confident <br> 
		that I will be successful. I hope that through my passion and enthusiasm I can help myself, <br> 
		and this world to be a better place.</p>
