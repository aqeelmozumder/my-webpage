			<p> My Favorite Gaming Quote: </p>
			
			<p> "Listen only to the sound of my voice. Let your mind relax. <br>
				Let your thoughts drift. Let the bad memories fade.<br>
				Let peace be upon you. Surrender yourself to your dreams.<br>
				Let them wash over you like the gentle waves of the bluest ocean.<br>
				Let them envelop you. Comfort you.<br>

				Imagine somewhere calm. Imagine somewhere safe.<br>
				Imagine yourself in a frozen forest. You're standing in a clearing.<br> 
				Trees around you so tall, they touch the sky.<br>
				Pure white snowflakes fall all around.<br> 
				You can feel them melt on your skin. You are not cold.<br>
				
				<br> It cannot overcome the warmth of your beating heart.<br>
				Can you hear it? You only have to listen.<br>
				Can you hear it slowing? You're slowing it. <br>
				You are in control. Calm. At peace." <br>
				
				<br>:By Corvus from Call of Duty Black Ops 3 <br>
